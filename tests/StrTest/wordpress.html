        <p>To date, I’ve worked with clients which pay me $120,000 a year as a developer.</p>
        <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

        <!-- wp:paragraph -->
        <p>Whether it’s writing code to control medical infusion pumps, automating entire business processes or handling
            credit / debit card payments for client needs.</p>

<h2 id="h-but-it-wasn-t-always-this-way">But it wasn’t always this way...</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I used to work for a typical 9-5 company, I was treated as a code monkey, someone who would come in and be told to
    just “churn” out code all down for the investors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No rewards for my hard work and often told by the “boss” with 30 years experience how much of an idiot I was, on a
    daily basis.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The promised salary rise was forgotten.<br>All the benefits when I signed up quickly fadded.<br>And I had to fight
    and justify why I deserved to take off 2 days vacation, with 2 months notice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was hell.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eventually, I decided, enough was enough.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And like you, I started to realise the wealth of opportunites out in the world.<br>I took the plunge and threw myself
    out there.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At first it was tough, many months would go by without a single dollar made.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eventually though through sheer will, I secured my first client.<br>Then, my second, my third and so on...</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I hit the jackpot when I secured the often sought, $500 per day client.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These days, I focus my time on a 50/50 basis.<br>Client work, first and always.</p>

<p>Secondly, sharing knowledge with the world through this blog.</p>
